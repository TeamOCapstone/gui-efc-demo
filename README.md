What I've done so far:

1) Added Text Fields for all of the inputs listed on Heather's spreadsheet. 

Problems with the current program:

1) I don't know how to alter the IO class to allow for the program to save/load the states of the checkbox fields. 

2) Text fields need to be fixed so that the boxes actually show.

3) Text boxes/labels need to be straightened out. Unsure how to correctly do that. 

4) The ingredients still need to be figured out (how we're going to integrate that.)

5) The counties dropdown needs to change per State. I currently have all States in a string array. Should we have a separate class for the sake of having all the counties listed in a State?

6) Not so much a problem, but previous XML documents created from previous iterations of the program do not work with later versions.
