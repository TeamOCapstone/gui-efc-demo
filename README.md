Final Notes:

I wasn't able to implement a function to read the output XML file and display it dynamically on the output panels Nghia created. The main problem was that the output panels weren't created in a similar fashion as all the other panels, so I couldn't smoothly add the function. The output panels would most likely need to be created from scratch. If anyone with time wants to try and tackle this before we turn it in, good luck. Otherwise, I think we're fine with what we've got. The program shows that it's useable, and with more time can be completed to fulfill every request from the sponsors. There is a good base demo for anyone else to work with. 

A couple features that could be added by future programmers:
- Properly working output panel which includes completed output tables, variables loaded from an XML file
- Error-checking the text fields to make sure proper values are saved
- Proper help function that includes text explaining each of the panels
